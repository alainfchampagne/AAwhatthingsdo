<a href="http://www.whatthingsdo.com/AArtistTemplate.sit">In the template</a>, there are two included samples, one showing bleeds, and the other without bleeds.  They are in the preferred format, images containing 2 pages.  You can do 3 pages, but don't go more than that, as it takes awhile to load.  
<br><br>
NOTE:  If you're posting an archive of existing work, please let me know the original publication date, and I will adjust it on the post.  I'm aiming to have the "publish" dates on the comics roughly match the publish dates for the original work, so as to facilitate better archiving. 
<br><br>
Image preparation is done in Photoshop.
<br><br>
1. Paste greyscale lineart into the template file, on a layer beneath the "Overlay" layer. (Note, if you're running a color file, just follow the directions, but with color)
<br><br>
2. Scale image down, using free transform (command-T).  Hold the shift key down to insure that the vertical and horizontal scaling remain correct.  The outer edges of the panels should  touch the two vertical guides.  For our purposes, the guides show proper image placement, and the edge of the image is the edge of the page.
<br><br>
3.  Do the same for the second page.  Pages should have a distance between them equal to 2x the distance between panels.  
<br><br>
4.  Crop the image.  The distance from the top panel to the image edge, and the bottom panel to the image edge should be equal to the distance between panels.  
<br><br>
5. Save for web. Shift-option-command-S.  Save as a gif.  Start with 256 colors, lock the black and the background yellow color.  Reduce the number of colors until the image begins to degrade.  Save with as few colors as possible, while still maintaining the integrity of the image.  If you're doing an image with full color, do a JPEG instead, and save at somewhere between 80% and 60%.  Go as low as possible without getting image degradation. Then save it out.

<font id=basictext>

1. Go to whatthingsdo.com and log in on the top dropdown navigation. <br><br>

2. From the top dropdown nav, go to Posts > New Post. <br><br>

3. On the New posts page, type in title <br><br>

4. Click the photo icon next to "Upload/Insert <br><br>

5. Under "Add media files from your computer" click "Select Files" and find the files on your computer. 
When you've got it, highlight it, and click "Select." <br><br>

6. Your image will upload.  DO NOT fill in the Caption or Description.  Make sure under "Link URL" there is nothing listed, 
if there is, click "none."  BLANK BOXES, exept for title.  Below that, set ALIGNMENT: Center, SIZE: Full Size. THEN click "Insert into Post" at the bottom of the box. <br><br>


7. Under "Post Tags," if you haven't allready, type in the relevant tags.  That would be the title of the
	     story, the title of the book the story is from, and anything else you think makes sense.  If you've 
	     allready typed in the relevant tags, then just select them after clicking "Choose from the most used
	     tags in Post Tags."  If you're posting a series, MAKE SURE that your tags match from post to post. This
	     is necessary in order for the full story to appear. <br><br>

8. Under "Categories" select the relevant category. This will be "a comic" in most cases. <br><br>


9.  FINALLY, under "publish,"  click "Save Draft," and your post is ready to go. It will be scheduled, and go live
at the appointed time. <br><br>
	    

Done and done!<br><br>

<font id=authorheaders>What goes on my artist's page?</font><div id=keybump> </div>  

<font id=basictext>
The artist page is meant to be a profile of you as viewed through the lens of your work.  
This is a picture of you *as an artrist* and not necessarily the "real" you.  Which isn't to
say it is deceptive so much as that it is a selective view.  <br><br>


For the artist page, <a href="mailto:jordan@whatthingsdo.com">email me</a> the following items:<br><br>


Photo: color or bw, 300dpi<br><br>

Name: As you would like it to appear<br><br>

Quote: Your original words.  I know can be a pain, and if you'd prefer, I can dig through interviews or your comics, and find something suitable. <br><br> 

Biography:  An up to date biography.  Simplest is to grab it from wikipedia or a publisher site.  More 
difficult, but certainly appreciated, is to write it up yourself.<br><br>

Bibliography:  Names and dates of all published comics and minicomics.  If there is a link to purchase 
or to find out more about a book, please include that as well.<br><br>

Selected Interviews:  Links to all the interviews online that you're happy with.  If you don't want to do
this, I can put together a list.  <br><br>
